"Putting the Word in WordPress.  The Bible Plugin provides a simple Bible "
"reader in WordPress sites with the Bible text accessed through available "
"Bible APIs.  Localization and focus is a priority of this plugin with "
"admin settings allowing for selection of language, Bible version, number "
"of Bible versions available to the end-user, and design elements (fonts, "
"colors).  Simplicity and ease of use for the end-user is the second top "
"priority with the goal of an intuitive interface.  Initial development of "
"the plugin will be based on the Bible Brain / DBPv4 API but with the "
"intention of expanding to other Bible APIs in subsequent releases.  "
"Additional information is available in the SRS document on GitHub.\n"
